            Youâ€™re sitting in class, minding your own business, when you get a
            notification on your laptop.
          </p>
          <p>It's an email from the cafeteria.</p>

            Body: "For today only, weâ€™re releasing our Spicy Garlic Truffle
            Chicken Nuggets â€” available to the first 10 students who make it to
            the cafeteria. Once theyâ€™re goneâ€¦ theyâ€™re gone."

            Your heart skips a beat. These legendary nuggets donâ€™t come around
            often. But thereâ€™s a problem.

          <p>Youâ€™re stuck in the middle of a surprise pop quiz.</p>

            Youâ€™ll need to think fast, solve clues, and escape the classroom
            before time runs out â€” or risk missing the most iconic nugget drop
            of the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Will you make it out in time to secure the saucy prize before the
            other students?
